## About me

Nothing makes me happier than to see a business idea come to life. For more than 15 years, I’ve worked in four different countries (Philippines, Singapore, China, Sweden), gathering business requirements and transforming them to powerful systems/ solutions in complex industries (gaming, e-learning, social networking and travel education). I am empathetic and I love people, a combination that helps me bridge business and technology easily. I’m an advocate of the use of agile methodologies which ensures that all my projects, big and small reach a demo-able state, open to feedback and are meeting business needs.
